Credit Report Summary Analysis Dashboard (2021-2024)
I recently developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze credit report performance across different banks with a strong focus on over 4 Years growth, decline and performance insights. To develop it, I have to preprocess datas from provided excel files to Jupyter(Python).
Tools: Power BI. Excel, Jupyter, Python.
Dashboard Features:
1. Top 3 Growing & Declining Banks.
2. Monthly & Yearly Bank Slicers for dynamic filtering
3. Credit Report Summarization per Year
4. Highest Performing Bank (over 4 years)
5. Lowest Performing Bank (over 4 years)
6. Credit Report Trends across years
7. Max Credit Bank with Month and Year
8. Min Credit Bank with Month and Year

This dashboard tries to provide insights into banks performance trends and make it easy for stakeholders to identify growth opportunities, risks and overall credit dynamics.
